      <h3>Artificial Intellingence and Machine Learning</h3>
      <p>Artificial intelligence and machine learning once represented the cutting edge of computer science.
        When these technologies were created in the last 20th century, they hardly had any applications and
        were, in fact, mostly academic. However, these technologies have gained applications over the years
        and reached ordinary people’s hands through their mobile phones and is currently one of the latest
        technologies in computer science.</p>

      <h3>Data Science</h3>
      <p>Recent technology in computer science is Data Science. For much of the initial part of the 21st century,
        data science was the next big thing. Data science has been around for much longer than just the past twenty
        months. For centuries, data analysis has been an essential task for companies, government, institutions, and
        departments. Analysing data helps understand the efficiency of processes, conduct surveys of the workforce,
        and gauge people’s general mood.</p>

      <h3>Full Stack Development</h3>
      <p>The 21st century started with the dot com boom, and the internet, a relatively new phenomenon, was spreading
        across homes in the world. In those days, websites were no more than simple web pages, and web development wasn’t
        the complex field that it is now. These days, web development involves a front end and a back end. Especially for
        fields related to services, such as retail and e-commerce, websites include a client-side—the website that you
        see—and a server-side—the website that the company controls.</p>
